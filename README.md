# Ember Rolodex

This application is an example of what an Ember tutorial between the quick start and Super Rents could look like.
Ideally it covers the following topics:

* Routing
  * Index Routes
  * Dynamic Routes
* Built in Components
  * `link-to`
  * `input`
* Actions
  * Submit actions
* Networking
  * Using `fetch`
  * Using Ember Data
